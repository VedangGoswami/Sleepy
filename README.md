# MaskDetection
Deep Learning code to detect face mask
I've succesfully trained a Deep Learning model with just 30 trainig picture dataset leveraging tranfer learning method. 
Work done:
- Creating own dataset
- Labelling dataset
- Using pre-trained model
- Pipeline configuration
- Training
- Testing
